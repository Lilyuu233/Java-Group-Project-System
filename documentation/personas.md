# Personas

## Control Systems Engineer (Primary User)

### Name:
Plosh Jumbly

### Age
35

### Key Responsibilities:

1. Ensuring the efficient storage of data
2. Maintaining high compression performance
3. Design and implement the automated control systems that regulate the processes in the plant
4. Ensure the automation systems operate efficiently and meet process requirements

### Core Needs:

1. A way of comparing parameters for the compression algorithm and finding the optimal settings for maximum compression performance
2. Optimisation recommendations that the tool suggests so that Josh can find the best approach without manual tuning
3. Exportable reports and parameter values
4. Settings to ensure sufficiently accurate data storage while minimising data storage requirements

### Key Quote:

"I need to store infinite data in finite space"

## Control Engineer

### Name:
Nuce Bricolson

### Age:
29

### Key Responsibilities:

1. Ensuring correctness in data that is compressed
2. Adjusting precision of compression algorithm to meet data fidelity needs
3. Work closely with Control Systems Engineers and Process Engineers

### Core Needs:

1. Customisable compression settings that allow for fine tuning for optimisating compression without compromising critical information
2. Visual feedback on errors and data losses caused by compression
3. Maintaining data fidelity in order to prevent trends or calculations on the compressed data down the line causing inaccuracies or misrepresentations
4. Allow for diagnostics and troubleshooting

### Key Quote:

"You can compress data to 0 bytes if you delete the file!"


## Process Engineer

### Name:
Gert Me Dare

### Age:
34

### Key Responsibilities:

1. Conducting research to ensure data is being compressed in the intended way.
2. Ensure that quality is maintained after the impact of the data compression.
3. Making reccommendations for improvement and optimisation of compression process.
4. Analyse system performance, design process changes and ensure regulatory complaiance


### Core Needs:

1. Ability to provide feedback for compression system depending on the intended results.
2. Access to a measure of quality after the data has undergone the impact of the compression.

### Key Quotes:

"We need to make this as small as possible but still just as good"



## Operator

### Name:
Tammie Jycross

### Age:
36

### Key Responsibilities:

1. Producing a dataset which needs to be compressed.
2. Managing and maintaining accurate records of information and ensuring it is consistent.
3. Real-time monitoring and control of plant processes.
4. Act as first line of defense in identifying abnormalities.

### Core Needs:

1. Ability to see the process of data compression to gain a wider understanding of the process (in relation to data collection process)
2. Use real-time and historical data to understand trends.


### Key Quotes:

"Can you explain how the compression process will impact my data collection/production?"
