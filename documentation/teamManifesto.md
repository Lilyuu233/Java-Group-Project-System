## Team Manifesto

1.	All communication should be polite, professional and clear to keep information organised and able to be referenced in future when needed.
2.	We will ensure that our skills, strengths, weaknesses and preferences are properly communicated so that work can be delegated and executed effectively.
3.	We agree to have regular meetings, make notes, monitor attendance and ensure every individual is listened to so that we are all involved and informed across all aspects of the project.
4.	We agree to respect the team leader's decisions - if we have any issues or disagreements, we will raise them politely and professionally, maintaining an open discussion and ensuring all team members feel valued.
5.	We agree to follow test driven development so that we can plan how our project will function from the beginning, giving us a clear end goal to work towards.
6.	We know that everyone must contribute to the project for its success, and so will all strive to have responsibility and ambition towards completing our work.
7.	When agreeing on a mutual plan for our work process, we understand that we may need to compromise on our ideas for the success of the project.
8.	We will utilise agile methodologies such as biweekly sprint meetings to assign tasks fairly to team members, allowing individuals to carry out work competently and autonomously.
9.	If any work is not likely to be ready on time, we agree to inform the team leader so that they can help and advise how we can mitigate potential issues.
10.	We agree to check Microsoft Teams and our university emails regularly to keep ourselves informed of updates, from industry or team members, to ask the team for support if we are unsure what to do, and to ensure that we stay on schedule.
